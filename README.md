<!-- ABOUT Raax-OG-FN -->
## About Raax-OG-FN

Out the box, Raax-OG-FN comes with some stand out features that make it the perfect base.
- Automatic offset and VFT index updating
- Compile time string encryption ([skCrypter](https://github.com/skadro-official/skCrypter))
- Windows API function hiding ([LazyImporter](https://github.com/JustasMasiulis/lazy_importer))



<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How it works

This is quite a complicated question to answer on this project, as it has grown a lot bigger than I anticipated.
For now, until I finish writing this readme, you should look at the source on your own. Make sure to take a look at Globals.h and make sure everything matches your specific usage.



<!-- ABOUT Raax-OG-FN -->
## Developers Read Me
I know the code base for this project is quite big for a Fortnite cheat, so I've tried to document eveything well in the files, however it still won't be perfect so here are 2 things you NEED to know before you start developing with this source.

### Namespaces
There are 3 main namespaces, SDK (you can guess what that is), Actors, Game and Features. Here is the purpose of each:
- SDK: The SDK
- Actors: Cached info's on various actors, as well as the loops for them (AFortPawn, AFortPickup etc)
- Game: Simple functions for drawing menu and ESP, current game frame, screen dimensions etc
- Features: Now I know alot of people clown for using this the nesting can become annoying, but I think it's important for clarity. If you go to Game/Features you will see it simply contains all things like AFortPawn bone IDs, targetting system, exploits (vehicles, pickups etc etc)

### Wrappers
I take advantage of wrappers and abstraction alot here, so most of the time like with K2_Project for example, you will not need to get the canvas and call it, there is a wrapper simply called Project in the SDK namespace. I advise you to go to Game/SDK/SDK/Engine_classes.h and look at all the wrappers at the bottom to avoid redundunt code

### Overall
Overall, just explore the project. There is already tons of code using everything how I intended so you can simply follow that style
